          NEO CRAFT is a Berlin-based furniture label founded by designer
          Sebastian Scherer in 2015. It is dedicated to merging traditional
          craftsmanship with contemporary production techniques. NEO/CRAFT
          challenges conventional ideas of material, form, and function,
          reinterpreting them to create innovative and unexpected designs. At
          the heart of NEO/CRAFT lies a distinctive approach to material
          exploration and development. While the current focus is on metal,
          glass, and wood, the search for new directions and fresh perspectives
          remains a fundamental part of the brandâ€™s philosophy.
